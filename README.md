# SHI Dashboard

SHI Dashboard is a customizable dashboard add-on for Home Assistant. It allows users to configure rooms and cards using simple YAML without writing code. The provided `dashboard.py` utility converts a user-defined configuration file into a Lovelace dashboard.

## Installation

Install the add-on through HACS for the simplest setup:
1. In HACS, add `https://github.com/user/Smart-Dashboard` as a custom repository of type "integration".
2. Search for **SHI Dashboard** and install it.
3. Open **Settings â†’ Devices & Services** in Home Assistant and choose **Add Integration**.
   Select **SHI Dashboard** to complete the setup.
4. Restart Home Assistant to generate the default `shi_dashboard.yaml` and
   `dashboards/shi_dashboard.yaml`.
   The integration files are placed under `custom_components/shi_dashboard` in
   your Home Assistant configuration.

See [`docs/INSTALLATION.md`](docs/INSTALLATION.md) for more details.

## Getting Started

1. Restart Home Assistant after installing the integration.
   A default configuration will be created as `shi_dashboard.yaml` and a dashboard
   generated at `dashboards/shi_dashboard.yaml`.
2. Add the following to your `configuration.yaml` to show the dashboard
   automatically:

   ```yaml
   lovelace:
     dashboards:
       shi_dashboard:
         mode: yaml
         title: SHI Dashboard
         icon: mdi:monitor-dashboard
         show_in_sidebar: true
         filename: dashboards/shi_dashboard.yaml
   ```
3. Reload Lovelace or restart Home Assistant again to see the new dashboard.
4. You can edit `shi_dashboard.yaml` at any time to customise the layout and run
   the generator manually if you wish.

## Auto Device Detection

Setting `auto_discover: true` in `shi_dashboard.yaml` will query your Home Assistant instance for all available entities. The environment variables `HASS_URL` and `HASS_TOKEN` must be set so the generator can connect to the API.

Discovered devices are added to a room named "Auto Detected" using sensible card types.

## Example Configuration

```yaml
auto_discover: false
layout:
  strategy: masonry
rooms:
  - name: Living Room
    cards:
      - type: thermostat
        entity: climate.living_room
      - type: light
        entity: light.ceiling
  - name: Bedroom
    layout: horizontal
    cards:
      - type: light
        entity: light.bedside
```

This generates a dashboard with two rooms and demonstrates layout configuration. Set `auto_discover` to `true` to automatically include all detected devices.
