# Installation Guide

Follow these steps to install the Smart Dashboard custom integration into Home Assistant.

## Install with HACS
1. In HACS, add `https://github.com/user/Smart-Dashboard` as a custom repository of type "integration".
2. Search for **Smart Dashboard** and install it.
3. Open **Settings â†’ Devices & Services** in Home Assistant and click **Add Integration**.
   Choose **Smart Dashboard** to create the configuration entry.
4. Restart Home Assistant to activate the integration.
   Since `manifest.json` enables a `config_flow`, Smart Dashboard appears automatically in the **Add Integration** list.

## Generate Your First Dashboard
1. The first start creates `smart_dashboard.yaml` and `dashboards/smart_dashboard.yaml` automatically.
2. Run `setup_dashboard.py` to insert the dashboard configuration automatically:

   ```bash
   python3 setup_dashboard.py /path/to/your/homeassistant
   ```

   This helper updates `configuration.yaml` for you.
3. Reload Lovelace or restart Home Assistant to see the dashboard.
4. To regenerate manually, run:

   ```bash
 python3 custom_components/smart_dashboard/dashboard.py smart_dashboard.yaml \
      --output dashboards/smart_dashboard.yaml
  ```

You can also define a Lovelace theme by adding `theme: <name>` to
`smart_dashboard.yaml`.

Rooms may specify an `order` field so they appear in a custom sequence on the
dashboard.

   Pass `--template <template.j2>` to use a custom Jinja2 template if desired.

   Auto discovery is on by default. When running outside Home Assistant **be sure**
   to set `HASS_URL` and `HASS_TOKEN` so the generator can query the API. When
   executed within Home Assistant it automatically uses its own credentials.
Entities are grouped by area when possible; if no areas are available they are
placed in a single "Auto Detected" room. Within each area the devices are
organized into light, climate, multimedia and sensor sections to create a cleaner layout.

Set the `SHI_LANG` environment variable (for example `en`, `ru`, `bg`, or `es`) to
generate the dashboard in a different language.

## Plugins

Modules placed in `custom_components/smart_dashboard/plugins` can modify the
configuration before generation. Each module should define
`process_config(config)`. See `header_card.py` for an example.
